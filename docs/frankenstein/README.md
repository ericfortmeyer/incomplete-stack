# Frankenstein Artifacts

Contains apt packages and sources for historical purposes and to troubleshoot standing up similar environments.

Frankenstein was an aptly-named free computer hacked into a usable developer workstation

## Components

* Legacy NVIDIA GEFORCE GT640
* 512GB SSD w/ Ubuntu 24.04 for projects/a
* 1TB HDD w/ Debian 12 for projects/b

Bind mounts were cleverly configured to make the Debian 12 on HDD operable under heavy development workloads.
