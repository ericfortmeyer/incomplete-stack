# Philosophy

**incomplete-stack** is my evolving homelab environment — a place where systems,
configs, and ideas shift over time. Inspired by Gödel’s Incompleteness Theorem,
the repo embraces a simple truth: no system is ever fully finished, and that’s
okay.

This project isn’t about perfection. It’s about **Structured Progress**:
intentional, incremental steps toward stability, flexibility, and clarity across
a small fleet of imperfect machines.

- **Samson** — Ubuntu: the sturdy but occasionally unpredictable workhorse.
- **Hiram** — Debian: steady, minimal, and reliable.
- **Gödel** — NixOS: declarative, experimental, and conceptually pure.

Together, these machines form an environment where I can:

- learn new tools and languages,
- explore system design,
- manage real-world infrastructure,
- and maintain a sense of humor about the messy parts.

The goal isn’t to eliminate imperfection — it's to work with it, understand it,
and build systems that evolve deliberately rather than chaotically.

Welcome to the incomplete stack — always inconsistent, always improving, never
done.
