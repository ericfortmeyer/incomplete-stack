# incomplete-stack

A deliberately imperfect collection of configs, scripts, and system definitions
for my evolving homelab machines — Samson (Ubuntu), Hiram (Debian), and Gödel
(NixOS).

Inspired by Gödel’s Incompleteness Theorem, the repo embraces the idea that no
system can ever be fully complete — and that’s part of the fun. This monorepo
holds the moving pieces of a home infrastructure that grows, adapts, and stays
intentionally unfinished.
